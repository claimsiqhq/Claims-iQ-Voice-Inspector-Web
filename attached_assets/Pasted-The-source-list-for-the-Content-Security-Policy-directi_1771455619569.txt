a3b3e429a5558d90.js:14 Cache data may be lost when replacing the hostingBuildDeployActionUpdates field of a Subscription object.

This could cause additional (usually avoidable) network requests to fetch data that were otherwise cached.

To address this problem (which is not a bug in Apollo Client), either ensure all objects of type HostingBuildDeployLogAction and HostingBuildDeployStatusAction have an ID or a custom merge function, or define a custom merge function for the Subscription.hostingBuildDeployActionUpdates field, so InMemoryCache can safely merge these objects:

  existing: {"__typename":"HostingBuildDeployLogAction","log":"\r\u001b[38;2;169;169;169m2026-02-18T22:11:47Z\u001b[37m \u001b[32minfo\u001b[37m: Build: 30b7fba8-0869-4566-9136-611ee0b20a1b\r\n"}
  incoming: {"__typename":"HostingBuildDeployStatusAction","status":"security_scanning","message":null,"debugSummary":null}

For more information about these options, please refer to the documentation:

Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-...'), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution.

Note also that 'script-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback. The action has been blocked.
