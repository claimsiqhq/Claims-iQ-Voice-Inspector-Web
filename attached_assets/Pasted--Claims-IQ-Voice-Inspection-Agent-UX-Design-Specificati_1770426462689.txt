## 2. Information Architecture & Navigation

### 2.1 Screen Map

The application follows a linear flow with two distinct acts. Navigation is primarily forward-progression with the ability to review previous steps.

| Screen | Description |
|---|---|
| **1. Claims List** | Home screen. List of claims with status badges. Tap to open a claim. Search + filter. New Claim button. |
| **2. Document Upload** | Three document upload slots (FNOL, Policy, Endorsements). Drag-drop or file picker. Processing status per document. Extraction preview cards. |
| **3. Extraction Review** | AI-parsed results from each document displayed in editable cards. Adjuster confirms or corrects extractions before briefing generation. |
| **4. Inspection Briefing** | Synthesized intelligence from all 3 documents. Property profile, coverage snapshot, peril-specific checklist, endorsement impacts. START INSPECTION button. |
| **5. Active Inspection** | Voice-driven HUD. Waveform, live transcription, phase indicator, current context, quick-action bar, running documentation sidebar. |
| **5a. Camera Capture** | Overlay/modal triggered by voice or tap. Camera viewfinder with auto-tag from current context. Returns to active inspection after capture. |
| **5b. Moisture Map** | Conditional panel for water claims. Grid of readings, drying equipment calculator, class/category display. |
| **6. Progress Map** | Visual overview of inspected areas. Room cards with status colors. Tap to jump to a room. Can be accessed as a sidebar during active inspection. |
| **7. Review & Finalize** | Full estimate breakdown by structure/area/zone. Photo gallery. Scope completeness checklist. Policy limit comparison. Adjuster notes. |
| **8. Export** | ESX file generation, PDF report preview, submission for review. Share options. |

### 2.2 Navigation Pattern

**Primary:** Linear forward progression (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 8). During Active Inspection (screen 5), the voice agent manages transitions between sub-screens (5a Camera, 5b Moisture). The Progress Map (6) is accessible as a slide-over panel during inspection. The adjuster can say "show me what we have so far" to access Review (7) mid-inspection.

Back navigation is always available. The app remembers state — leaving Active Inspection and returning resumes exactly where the adjuster left off.

## 3. Screen-by-Screen Specifications

### Screen 1: Claims List

**PURPOSE**
Home screen. The adjuster sees all their assigned claims and can start a new one.

**LAYOUT**
Top nav bar (Deep Purple `#342A4F`): Claims IQ logo left, user avatar + org name right. Below: search bar + filter chips (All, Pending, In Progress, Complete). Main area: scrollable list of claim cards.

**CLAIM CARD CONTENTS**

**LAYOUT**
Three vertical cards, each representing a document type. Each card has four states: Empty (upload prompt), Uploading (progress bar), Processing (AI parsing animation), Parsed (extraction preview).

**DOCUMENT CARDS**

| Document | Icon / Color | What AI Extracts |
|---|---|---|
| FNOL (First Notice of Loss) | Primary Purple file icon (`#7763B7`) | Insured name, address, date of loss, peril type, reported damage description, property details, claim number |
| Policy (HO 80 03) | Secondary Purple shield icon (`#9D8BBF`) | Coverage A-F limits, deductible amount, loss settlement provisions, dwelling description, construction type, year built, special conditions |
| Endorsements | Gold document stack icon (`#C6A54E`) | Each endorsement ID, what it modifies, effective dates, sublimits, special provisions (e.g., HO 88 02 roof schedule, HO 81 17 water backup, HO 86 05 ordinance/law) |

**UPLOAD INTERACTION**
Tap card → native file picker (PDF, images accepted). Drag-and-drop supported. Upload starts immediately. Progress bar replaces upload prompt. On completion, card transitions to Processing state with a subtle pulse animation. When parsing completes, card shows green checkmark and extraction summary (3-4 key fields visible). Tap card to expand full extraction on Screen 3.

**FOOTER**
Bottom bar: "Generate Briefing" button (disabled until all 3 documents are parsed). Status text: "2 of 3 documents processed"

---

### Screen 3: Extraction Review

**PURPOSE**
The adjuster reviews what the AI extracted from each document and corrects any errors before the briefing is generated. This is the human-in-the-loop quality gate.

**LAYOUT**
Three-tab interface (FNOL | Policy | Endorsements) or collapsible accordion sections. Each section shows extracted fields in editable form format — pre-filled by AI, editable by adjuster.

**FNOL EXTRACTION FIELDS**

| Construction Type | Dropdown: Frame, Masonry, Steel, etc. |
| Roof Type Noted | Text, editable (composition shingle, tile, metal, etc.) |
| Special Conditions | Multi-line text, editable |

**ENDORSEMENT EXTRACTION**
List of extracted endorsements, each as an expandable card showing: Endorsement ID (e.g., HO 88 02), Title, What It Modifies, Key Provisions. Add/Remove endorsement buttons if AI missed or hallucinated one.

**FOOTER**
"Confirm Extractions & Generate Briefing" button. All fields with low confidence are highlighted amber — adjuster should review these.

---

### Screen 4: Inspection Briefing

**PURPOSE**
The synthesized mission brief. Everything the adjuster needs to know before walking the property, derived from all three documents.

**LAYOUT**
Single scrollable screen with distinct sections. Clean card-based layout. This is the last screen before going on-site.

**SECTIONS**

---

## 4. Voice Interaction Patterns

### 4.1 Voice-to-UI Mapping

Every voice utterance triggers both an agent action and a UI response. The screen must confirm what the agent understood.

| Adjuster Says | Agent Does | UI Shows |
|---|---|---|
| "Let's start with the roof" | Sets context to Exterior > Roof, activates Phase 3 | Phase stepper highlights Phase 3, context card shows "Exterior — Roof", checklist items for roof appear |
| "Composition shingle, approximately 30 squares" | Records roof material and size | Agent response bubble confirms: "Roof: composition shingle, ~30 squares" |
| "I count 12 hits in this test square" | Records test square data, assesses severity | Test square reading appears in sidebar, severity badge (moderate/severe) shown |
| "Take a photo" | Opens camera with auto-tag RF-TSQ-01 | Camera overlay slides up, auto-tag banner shows "RF-TSQ-01 — Roof Test Square #1" |
| "Moving inside to the master bedroom, 14 by 16" | Creates room, sets context to Interior | Phase shifts to Phase 4, room card appears in sidebar, context card updates |
| "Water staining on ceiling, NE corner, about 4 feet" | Adds damage zone, generates line items | Damage marker added, line items slide into right panel estimate |
| "Moisture reading 22 percent at the wall" | Records reading, plots on moisture grid | Moisture map updates if visible, reading appears in data list |
| "Show me what we have so far" | Pauses inspection, opens Review | Transitions to Review & Finalize (Screen 7), with "Resume Inspection" button |
| "We're done here" | Marks current room complete, prompts next | Room card turns green, agent asks "Shall we move to the next room?" |
| "Generate the estimate" | Triggers Phase 7, assembles all line items | Transitions to estimate assembly view, shows progress as items are compiled |

### 4.2 Error & Clarification States

When the agent needs clarification or encounters an error, the UI must make this obvious:

| State | UI Treatment |
|---|---|
| Agent didn't understand | Gold voice indicator + text: "I didn't catch that. Could you repeat?" Agent response bubble shows gold `#C6A54E` border. |
| Agent needs clarification | Secondary Purple indicator + specific question in agent bubble: "Is that 22% moisture on drywall or wood framing?" Options shown as tappable chips with Primary Purple fill. |
| Conflicting information | Amber card: "You mentioned 14×16 earlier but now said 14×14 — which is correct?" with two options. |
| API/system error | Red toast: "Connection issue — your data is saved locally. Retrying…" Never blocks the inspection flow. |
| Voice connection lost | Prominent red banner at top: "Voice disconnected — Reconnecting…" with manual reconnect button. |

---

## 5. State Management & Data Persistence

Every piece of data captured during the inspection must be persisted in real-time. If the app crashes or connection drops, no data is lost.

| State Category | What's Tracked |
|---|---|
| Claim Context | Claim ID, parsed FNOL data, policy extractions, endorsement data, briefing |
| Inspection Session | Current phase, current location (structure/area/room), session start time, agent mode |
| Rooms & Areas | Room definitions (name, dimensions), damage zones per room, status per room |
| Damage Observations | Type, location, severity, measurements, linked photos, linked line items |
| Photos | Image data, auto-tags, annotations, linked damage observations, timestamps |
| Moisture Readings | Location, value, material type, timestamp, linked room |
| Line Items | Xact code, description, quantity, unit, pricing, depreciation, provenance source |
| Voice Transcript | Full session transcript with timestamps (for audit trail) |
| Estimate Totals | Running RCV, ACV, depreciation, deductible application, net claim |

---

## Design Principles — Keep These Visible

1. **Voice is primary, screen confirms.** The adjuster should never need to stop inspecting to interact with the screen.

2. **Glanceable at arm's length.** Font sizes, color contrast, and indicator sizes must work when the iPad is on a surface or held in one hand.

3. **Progressive disclosure.** Don't show moisture tools on a hail claim. Don't show the full estimate during exterior walkthrough. Show what's relevant to the current phase.

4. **Never block the inspection.** Errors, loading states, and confirmations should be non-modal. The adjuster's voice flow should never be interrupted by a dialog box.

5. **Every action is reversible.** The adjuster can say "undo that" or "that's wrong, it's actually 14 by 18" and the system corrects gracefully.

6. **Real-time persistence.** If the app crashes, nothing is lost. Every utterance, every photo, every line item is saved the moment it's created.
